1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you to see bugs introduced?
Ans:

It was very easy and fun task to look at differences in the file by using diff command.
Hardest bugs, which were unable to be find, were easily findable through diff command.
Really, its a life saver for me! :)


2) How could easy access to the entire history of a file could help you as a programmer?
Ans:

I can go through my old changes that i have made earlier
and can revert back my current code to the older one which is more stabler than that of the current one.


3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Ans:

Pros:
	*	We know whan to create an ideal milestone. We can revert back to a point where we are sure that everything
		is working fine.
Cons:	
	*	We have to look at the commit often times when we are delaing with the modifications of the code.
	*	We might sometimes forget to commit the code when a new feature is intriduced, this will overlook some important
		modifications which might be helpful in the near future.

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, 
allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Ans:
Git makes it easier to track down all the files at a time when they have been modified,
rather than tracking a single file and comparing it with the tracking history of the other files in the same project.

5) How can you use git log and git diff to view the history of files?

ANS:

We can use git log to see all the commits of a particular repository. Then, we can use git diff commit_old commit_new to look
at the changes that have been made in the files from the old commit to the new commit.
